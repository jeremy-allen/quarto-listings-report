# quarto-listings-report

## Why use cards in a report?

- Often tables of data are too wide to easily read in a quick meeting
- Some long text fields in tables are cumbersome
- Cards can more neatly arrange the same data
- Cards can be easier to read quickly

## What is different here?

Using a modified quarto listings page as a report instead of a blog landing page. In the custom css I added a scroll bar to the card description field to allow for longer text in the field. I also set a new max description length in the YAML of each listings definitions.
